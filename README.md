# Visuals-with-Python
# Welcome to Python Visualization Studio! This repository contains a collection of data visualizations created using popular Python libraries such as matplotlib. Each visual represents different types of charts and graphs, showcasing a variety of data analysis techniques.
# Charts Included
# This repository contains the following types of charts:
# Line Charts – Simple and multi-line charts for tracking trends over time.
# Bar Charts – Vertical and horizontal bar charts for comparing categories.
# Histograms – Distribution plots for visualizing data distributions.
# Scatter Plots – Scatter plots for displaying relationships between two variables.
# Box Plots – Visualizations of the distribution of data and outliers.
# Heatmaps – Correlation matrices and other heatmap visualizations.
# Pie Charts – Circular charts to represent proportions.
# Violin Plots – Combination of box plot and kernel density estimate.
# Pair Plots – Multi-variable comparison with pairwise relationships and histograms.
# Swarm Plots – Categorical scatter plots that reveal distribution.
# Libraries Used
# This project uses the following Python libraries:
# Matplotlib – For general plotting and creating a wide variety of charts.
